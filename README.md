# internship_hunt
This is a project for automated search and filling of job applications that we crafted for the hackathon "Multimodal Agents", hosted by Weights &amp; Biases on Feb 15–16, 2025 in San Francisco.

## Inspiration
Our journey began as college freshmen, navigating the complex transition from the academic to the professional world. We realized that many students have the same struggle with understanding how their skills translate into real-world problems. Hence, we decided to create a tool that could make applying for internships more efficient—making it easier to see the path to their dream careers and more confidently enter the professional environment.

## What it does
Internship Hunt w/Agno, Gemini, and AgentQL analyzes resumes using Google Gemini to fill in gaps and clarify details, scans the web for job opportunities using AgentQL, providing personalized recommendations, extracts job application details, and assists with cover letters by generating custom, professional texts rich in detail based on both resume data and job specifications.

## How we built it
We built our project with open-source and AI tools like Streamlit, Gemini, AgentQL, and Agno.

## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult to connect Gemini and AgentQL and manage all the API configurations. Making sure the links with internship opportunities returned by the model were accessible and scannable through their href.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We developed a system that provides personalized advice rather than generic guidance for job applications. In the near future, we plan to make everything automatized and reliable to completely change the job applications game for newcomers.

## What we learned
We learned how to use AgentQL for web scraping and to generate detailed reports on job application requirements.

## What's next for Internship Hunt?
We plan to run a pilot test at Minerva University, using metrics like internship offers and user engagement, to gauge the platform's effectiveness before an official launch.

## Built With
agentql, agno, gemini, json, os, pypdf2, python, python-docx, replit, streamlit
